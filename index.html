                <h4>Life Guard</h4>
                <p>
                    During my experience working as a Lifeguard for The Myopia Hunt Club I was in charge of watching over the pool and surronding area making sure that all the rules were being followed. Also, I had to make sure the chemical level in the pool was correct. This job taught me skills on how to work with my fellow lifegaurds to create not just a safe enviornment but a fun one for our patrons, and how to balance the responsibilities of managing chemical levels and making sure to enforce the rules.

                <h3>Lowes Home Improvement</h3>
                <h4>Internet Fullfillment Associate</h4>
                <p>
                    Working this position at Lowes is quite a stressfull experience, because you must juggle the responsibility of fullfilling the orders and helping customers. Thankfully juggling responsibilities was a skill that I learned in my previous job working at the Myopia Hunt Club and I really honed it working in this position. This position had me collecting items from around the store that customers have ordered online as well as helping other customers in the store. A skill that this position taught me was how to prioritize projects. This skill was crucial to the job because most times we would have multiple orders and not enough staff, so I would have to decide which orders I would prioritize. I would do this by figuring out which items needed to be retrieved first and then using my knowledge of the store either retriving the order of the person who has been waiting the longest or if there were multiple orders in the same area I would pick those up first to reduce the load on my coworkers.

                <h4>Flooring Associate</h4>
                <p>
                    After working in Internet Fullfillment I decided to switch into the flooring department. My duties revolved around helping clients pick out either tile or carpeting for their house, restocking shelves, and other general maintance of my department. The reason I made the switch was because of the flooring department was understaffed and I figured that my physical capabilities would be a big help for my coworkers who were already in the department. My impact was seen immediately transforming my department from one of the most disorganized and least profitable departments to the gold standard of organization and one of the most profitable departments. My efforts were recognized by the store manager earning me a Service Star Award. My direct supervisor even commented saying that it was the fastest he's seen someone earn one. This role really pushed me to manage my time correctly so I could acomplish as much as possible in my shift. And since my department was so understaffed it built my relationship with the coworkers I did have making me into a better team player.

                <p>
                    After working at Lowes I decided to switch to make the switch to work at Home Depot. At this company I decided to again switch to a different department. This new department was tool rental, this job required me to learn how to use and maintain heavy machinery. In this experience I learned how to work with and provide for customers who were needing equipment for professional jobs, instead of the diy customers I was used to working for. This required me to improve my knowledge and skills with a number of machines I had never used. This quick and steep learning curve was difficult at first but thanks to my coworkers I was able to learn very quickly.
